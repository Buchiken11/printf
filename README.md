This is the first team collaboration between Buchi and Oladakinjoye.
We are building a custom printf that can perform the same function with that of the standard printf in the stdio.h.
we handled the following speciifiers in this projsct:
NULL
s
d
i
c
x
X: HEXADECIMAL AND MANY MORE SPECIFIERS.
HAPPY CODING
